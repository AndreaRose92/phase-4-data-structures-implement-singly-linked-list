#  Singly Linked List Methods Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build out common methods for a `Singly Linked List`

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, you learned what a `Singly Linked List` is and we built out the initial `LinkedList` and `Node` classes.
We also learned how to add to our `Singly Linked List`. In this lab let's build out some more of the common methods we might need when using a  `Singly Linked List`.

Fork and clone this lab; you'll be coding in the `lib` folder. You can
run the tests at any point using `learn test` to check your work.

## Instructions

Start by building out the `LinkedList` class.

Once you have the first test passing, build out the following methods:

- `remove`: removes the element at the end of the list
- `add_at`: adds a node in the middle of the linked list
- `find_node`: finds a node within the list
